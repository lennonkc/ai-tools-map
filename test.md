- Use Cases
  - Non API tasks
    - Some platforms not even provide APIs
    - API data inaccuracies
    - Reason
      - Cost
        - Unlike the WEB, Font Web is built 100% tightly integrated with a real database and genuine back-end logic. However, API services are an additional component, typically developed separately from the main logic, which results in extra costs.
      - Complexity
        - API calling complexity causing most platform will not 1:1 100% provides exact API. 
    - Real Cases
      - Netsuite
        - Unable to fetch data from **Customized Search**can only read it by Suite_Script+API
          - **Customized Search is** System level search using huge computing resource of Netsuite system.Providing that API will causing high complexity and cost. so NetSuite only provides WEB button to fetch **Customized Search.** Or go with very complex SuiteScript.
      - Amazon Seller Center
        - FBAs details
        - users level order data
        - WHY?
          - it's a very natural thinking that because of security policy they don't provide API. but the truth is because of cost. for most e-selling platforms. The data is way toooooo big. Maintaining a real-time single order level or some small level data's API is not economical for them .As A Result, they hide the logic of real data. not providing data or just providing outdated data on API. but provides easy webpage buttons. They are a smart split users case, for small sellers, web is totally enough, for big sellers must have a scraper team to scrape data, that is also explaining that thrasio have many scripts running more than 3 years also because the WEB security level of seller center website is low. amazon intended to open a low protection WEB to let big sellers catch
      - They are real cases I met in the past 2 months. I believe that must be more.
