  - Non API tasks
    - Some platforms not even provide APIs
    - API data inaccuracies
    - Reason
      - Cost
        - Unlike the WEB, Font Web is built 100% tightly integrated with a real database and genuine back-end logic. However, API services are an additional component, typically developed separately from the main logic, which results in extra costs.

        - API calling complexity causing most platform will not 1:1 100% provides exact API. 
    - Real Cases
      - Netsuite

          - **Customized Search is** System level search using huge computing resource of Netsuite system.Providing that API will causing high complexity and cost. so NetSuite only provides WEB button to fetch **Customized Search.** Or go with very complex SuiteScript.
