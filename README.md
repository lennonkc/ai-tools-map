### Vision-Based
- Browser Operator
  - Examples
    - Amazon Seller Center
      - Amazon's API system is too large, which has led to many APIs being deprecated; <br>it has also resulted in a lack of many highly accurate data APIs.<br> So in this situation, a browser agent is needed to bypass APIs in order to complete the task.

      - [Automate](https://github.com/yuruotong1/autoMate)
        - Simply circle a spot on the screen, and the AI will take control of that area.
- Use Cases
  - Non API tasks
    - Some platforms not even provide APIs
    - API data inaccuracies
    - Reason
      - Cost
        - Unlike the WEB, Font Web is built 100% tightly integrated with a real database and genuine back-end logic. However, API 
        services are an additional component, typically developed separately from the main logic, which results in extra costs.
      - Complexity
        - API calling complexity causing most platform will not 1:1 100% provides exact API. 
    - Real Cases
      - Netsuite
        - Unable to fetch data from Customized Searchcan only read it by Suite_Script+API
      - Amazon Seller Center
        - FBAs details
        - users level order data
      - They are real cases I met in the past 2 months. I believe that must be more.
  - Handling highly repetitive tasks
### API-Based
- MCP ‚úÖ
  - MCP Market(all free)
    - <https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers>
    - <https://mcp.so/>
    - <https://glama.ai/mcp/servers>
    - <https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers>
    - More than thousands of pre-built MCPs, connected almost all known APPs or platform...<br>üö® MCPs is gradually replacing all the known APIs
  - MCP vs API
    - AI decide what APIs to call and complete entire task,  human don\`t need to work on API to API. <br> Only focus on NATURAL LANGUAGE to talk with MCP, teach MCP to call correct APIs
- Function Call ‚ùå <br>(Technologies on the verge of obsolescence)
  - Examples
    - Using different APIs to provide data to AI directly
  - Use cases
    - Connect Different Software that providing Nice APIs
